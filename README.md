# -Siri-Shortcuts---Designing-Developing-Custom-Siri-Intents-on-iOS-12
Designing and developing custom Siri Intents on iOS 12 involves using SiriKit to integrate your app with Siri. You can create custom intents to allow users to interact with your app via voice commands. In this example, I'll show you how to design a simple Siri Shortcut that gives Number Trivia when asked. This involves creating a custom Siri intent, handling it in your app, and exposing it to Siri.
Overview:

We will:

    Define a custom Siri Intent to fetch trivia based on a number.
    Use Siri Shortcuts to allow users to trigger that intent.
    Handle the intent in your app and provide the trivia for the number.
    Expose the intent to Siri.

Requirements:

    Xcode installed (iOS 12 or later).
    iOS 12+ device or simulator.
    An app that will handle the custom Siri intent.

Steps to Create a Custom Siri Intent with Number Trivia
1. Create a New Intent Definition File

First, you need to create an Intent Definition file in your app.

    Open your Xcode project.
    From the Xcode File menu, select New > File.
    Under Resource, choose Intent Definition File and click Next.
    Name the file (e.g., NumberTriviaIntent.intentdefinition) and save it.

2. Define the Custom Siri Intent

    Open the Intent Definition file you just created.
    Click the + button to add a new intent.
    Choose Custom Intent from the list of available intents.
    Name the intent (e.g., GetNumberTriviaIntent).
    Define the parameters for the intent:
        Add an Integer parameter to accept the number.
        Name it something like number or triviaNumber.

The intent will look like this:

    Intent Name: GetNumberTriviaIntent
    Parameters: number (type: Integer)

3. Create an Intent Handler

Now, you need to create an intent handler to respond to the Siri request. This will be a class that implements the INIntentHandler protocol.

    Create a new Swift file in your project (e.g., GetNumberTriviaIntentHandler.swift).
    Implement the handler like so:

import Foundation
import Intents

// Custom Intent Handler
class GetNumberTriviaIntentHandler: NSObject, GetNumberTriviaIntentHandling {
    
    // Implement the handle method for the custom intent
    func handle(intent: GetNumberTriviaIntent, completion: @escaping (GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse) -> Void) {
        // Get the number from the intent
        let number = intent.number ?? 0
        
        // Generate trivia based on the number
        let trivia = getNumberTrivia(for: number)
        
        // Create and return the response
        let response = GetNumberTriviaIntentResponse.success(trivia: trivia)
        completion(response)
    }
    
    // Optional: Provide the response if the number is invalid or if there's an error
    func resolveNumber(for intent: GetNumberTriviaIntent, with completion: @escaping (INIntegerResolutionResult) -> Void) {
        if let number = intent.number, number > 0 {
            completion(INIntegerResolutionResult.success(with: number))
        } else {
            completion(INIntegerResolutionResult.needsValue())
        }
    }

    private func getNumberTrivia(for number: Int) -> String {
        // Simple trivia example, you could expand this with an API for real trivia
        let triviaData = [
            1: "One is the first positive integer.",
            2: "Two is the only even prime number.",
            3: "Three is the number of dimensions in our universe.",
            10: "Ten is the base of our decimal number system.",
            42: "Forty-two is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything (according to Douglas Adams)."
        ]
        
        // Default trivia if the number is not predefined
        return triviaData[number, default: "No trivia available for this number."]
    }
}

This handler is responsible for:

    Fetching trivia based on the number passed by Siri.
    Returning a response that Siri can read back to the user.

4. Update App Delegate to Register the Intent

You need to ensure that your app handles the custom intent. Update your AppDelegate to register the handler.

import UIKit
import Intents

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        
        // Register custom intent handler
        let intentHandler = GetNumberTriviaIntentHandler()
        INVoiceShortcutCenter.shared.setShortcutItems([intentHandler])
        
        return true
    }
}

5. Enable Siri Capability

    In Xcode, open your project settings and go to the Signing & Capabilities tab.
    Enable the Siri capability to ensure your app can interact with Siri.
    Make sure you also enable App Intents (available in iOS 12+).

6. Create Siri Shortcuts

To create Siri Shortcuts programmatically or via the app's UI, follow these steps:

    Programmatically: You can add a shortcut for the custom intent using the INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController.

import IntentsUI

func addNumberTriviaShortcut() {
    let intent = GetNumberTriviaIntent()
    intent.number = 42  // For example, the user asks for trivia about the number 42
    
    let shortcut = INShortcut(intent: intent)
    
    let viewController = INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController(shortcut: shortcut)
    viewController.delegate = self
    
    present(viewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

    Using the Shortcuts App: Alternatively, users can add the shortcut manually via the Shortcuts app on their iOS device. Once the user has added the shortcut, they can trigger it using Siri, such as saying "Hey Siri, give me trivia about 42".

7. Handling User Interaction

Once the shortcut is added, the user can say something like, "Hey Siri, give me trivia about 42" to invoke the intent. Siri will invoke the handle(intent:) method in the handler, and the trivia will be returned as the response.
8. Testing the Siri Shortcut

    Test Siri Integration: On an actual iOS device (not the simulator), say the phrase you defined in the shortcut, such as "Hey Siri, give me trivia about 42".
    Handle Voice Input: Siri should call your intent handler and return the trivia to the user.

Conclusion

In this tutorial, weâ€™ve gone through creating a custom Siri Shortcut that fetches trivia for a number using SiriKit. We:

    Defined a custom intent in Xcode.
    Created an intent handler to fetch number trivia.
    Enabled Siri capabilities in the app and created a shortcut for it.
    Tested the integration with Siri to handle user requests.

This example demonstrates the basic process of creating a custom Siri intent. You can extend it with more complex data sources or actions (e.g., fetching trivia from an API) and further refine the Siri experience.
